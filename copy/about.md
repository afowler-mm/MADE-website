# About Maine Ad + Design

<div class="lede">

In 1923, forty years before the heyday of Don Draper, one of Americaâ€™s first ad clubs was dreamed up in a hotel room in cosmopolitan Portland, Maine. In the century since â€” first as the Portland Advertising Club, then the Advertising Club of Greater Portland (and then of Maine), and now as Maine Ad + Design â€” generations of Maine creative professionals have come together to connect, create, and celebrate everything that makes us tick.
