# About Maine Ad + Design

{% capture lede_content %}
In 1923, forty years before the heyday of Don Draper, one of America's first ad clubs was dreamed up in a hotel room in cosmopolitan Portland, Maine. In the century since â€” first as the Portland Advertising Club, then the Advertising Club of Greater Portland (and then of Maine), and now as Maine Ad + Design â€” generations of Maine creative professionals have come together to connect, create, and celebrate everything that makes us tick.

## Our mission

We are a nonprofit professional membership organization with a mission to celebrate, cultivate, and connect Maine's professional creative community. We achieve our mission through:

- Educational workshops
- Networking events
- Award recognition
- Funding for education

We are fundamentally a network of members. Our members include people working in or studying the commercial arts, including:

- Advertising, design, and marketing agencies
- Corporate/in-house marketing teams
- Media organizations
- Independent professionals
- Students

â€” in and around greater Portland, Lewiston and Auburn, Augusta, Bangor, the coast and islands, and all around the state (and including once and/or future Mainers, and Mainers at heart ðŸŒ²).

Maine Ad + Design is a community of tolerance and pride. We stand against oppression in all its forms, at large scales and at small ones, and are committed to cultivating diversity, inclusivity, equality, and kindness where we live and work.
